From now on the submission of new entries of methods for a type 3 challenge are accepted. The methods can be applied or retrained on a private dataset from clinical routine (radiotherapy at university hospital LÃ¼beck) with manual expert annotations for evaluation.

The results for this out-of-domain evaluation, which decouples model development from the actual data will be analysed and discussed at a virtual winter workshop in February 2024 with free participation for all participants or interested parties.

After MICCAI 2023: Participants algorithm development  
December 6, 2023: KickOff and virtual help session for type 3 challenge submission, find our slides here: https://cloud.imi.uni-luebeck.de/s/TgN3DsRid6zgDpB
