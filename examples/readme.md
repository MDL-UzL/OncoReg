# Examples

Here you can find exemplary submissions for our OncoReg challenge. You can use these as a guideline for creating your own submission and especially have a look at the containerisation process and if you like on the data loading.

Please also find our specifications for building a docker that works with our infrastructure.
Please adjust your training process to run on a NVIDIA RTX 4000 SFF Ada Generation GPU with 20 GB as this is what we provide for challenge submissions.

Expect the OncoReg data to be in the same format as the revised ThoraxCBCT data (256, 192, 192) which can be downloaded via our GrandChallenge Website.
